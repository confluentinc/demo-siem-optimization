# Optimize SIEM With Confluent

The examples in this repository give you hands-on experience optimizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions using Confluent. Each tutorial illustrates how to use Confluent to improve the response to a common cybersecurity scenario.

## Hands-On in Your Browser

This demo runs best using Gitpod. Gitpod uses your existing git service account (GitHub, Gitlab, or BitBucket) for authentication. See the [gitpod tips](./instructions/gitpod-tips.md) to get acquainted with gitpod.

**Launch a workspace** to get hands-on with the labs:
- https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-siem-optimization

If you want to launch a workspace that **automatically submits all connectors**, use this link instead:
- https://gitpod.io/#SUBMIT_CONNECTORS=true/https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-siem-optimization

If you want to run locally or in a different environment, see the [appendix](./instructions/appendix.md).
